### Pre-requisites
- **Java 8 or higher** -> [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **Any IDE** -> [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Description

#### Sorting Algorithms 
`Ordernamiento.java` contains the class with the sorting algorithms. Test in `PruebasOrdenamiento.java`.

1. Cocktail Sort: A variation of Bubble Sort that goes through the array in both directions.
2. Bucket Sort: A distribution sort that sorts elements by distributing them into several buckets.
3. Counting Sort: A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm suitable for sorting integers.
4. Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
5. Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
6. Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

#### Search Algorithms
`Busqueda.java` contains the class with the search algorithms. Test in same file. 

1. Binary Search: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
2. Linear Search: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within an array.
3. Violent Search: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within an array by brute force.
4. Jump Search: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by jumping ahead by fixed steps.
